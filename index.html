                    C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C Sharp”. It
                    was developed by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team within the .NET initiative and was
                    approved by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards
                    Organization (ISO). C# is among the languages for Common Language Infrastructure. C# is a lot
                    similar to Java syntactically and is easy for users who have knowledge of C, C++ or Java.</p>

                <p>
                    Most C# operations involve manipulating numbers and text, but anything that the computer can
                    physically do can be programmed in C#. Computers have no intelligence—they have to be told exactly
                    what to do, and their actions are defined by the programming language you use. Once programmed, they
                    can repeat the steps as many times as needed at high speed. Modern PCs are so fast they can count to
                    a billion in seconds.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Typical programming tasks include putting data into a database or pulling it out, displaying
                    high-speed graphics in a game or video, controlling electronic devices attached to the PC and
                    playing music or sound effects. You can even use it to write software to generate music or help you
                    compose.</p>

                <p>Some developers believe that C# is too slow for games because it is interpreted rather than compiled.
                    However the .NET Framework compiles the interpreted code the first time it runs.</p>

            <article>
                To get started with writing C#, open your editor and write your
                first "Hello world" C# code:
                <code>
                    Debug.Log("Hello World");
                </code>

            <article>
                <p>A variable is a name given to a storage area that is used to store values of various data types. Each
                    variable in C# needs to have a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's
                    memory. For example, a variable can be of the type String, which means that it will be used to store
                    a string value.</p>

                <p>Representation of 3D vectors and points.</p>
                <p>This structure is used throughout Unity to pass 3D positions and directions around. It also contains
                    functions for doing common vector operations.</p>
                <p>Besides the functions listed below, other classes can be used to manipulate vectors and points as
                    well. For example the Quaternion and the Matrix4x4 classes are useful for rotating or transforming
                    vectors and points.</p>

                <p>This structure is used in some places to represent 2D positions and vectors (e.g. texture coordinates
                    in a Mesh or texture offsets in Material). In the majority of other cases a Vector3 is used.</p>

            <article>
                <p>The animation component is used to play back animations.</p>
                <p>You can assign animation clips to the animation component and control playback from your script. The
                    animation system in Unity is weight-based and supports Animation Blending, Additive animations,
                    Animation Mixing, Layers and full control over all aspects of playback.</p>
                <p>AnimationState can be used to change the layer of an animation, modify playback speed, and for direct
                    control over blending and mixing.</p>
                <p>Also Animation supports enumerators. Looping through all AnimationStates is performed like this:</p>
                <code>using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Animation anim;

    void Start()
    {
        anim = GetComponent<Animation>();
        foreach (AnimationState state in anim)
        {
            state.speed = 0.5F;
        }
    }

                <p>Another important concept to create larger programs is loops. You'll use loops to repeat statements
                    that you want executed more than once. Try this code in the interactive window:</p>
                <code>public class ForLoop : MonoBehaviour
{
    int numEnemies = 3;
    
    
    void Start ()
    {
        for(int i = 0; i  numEnemies; i++)
        {
            Debug.Log("Creating enemy number: " + i);
        }
    }
}

                <p>Represents text as a series of Unicode characters.</p>
                <p>Unity uses the .Net System.String class for strings. See the Microsoft MSDN documentation for Strings
                    for more details.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> In c# string is an alias for System.String. This means that you can use either
                    string or String in your code (if you have added using System to the top of your script.)
                    <strong>Note:</strong> In Javascript strings are represented using String which you should use in
                    your Unity script code. Here are some basic uses of the String class.
                </p>

                <p>Suspends the coroutine execution for the given amount of seconds using scaled time.</p>
                <p>The actual time suspended is equal to the given time multiplied by Time.timeScale. See
                    WaitForSecondsRealtime if you wish to wait using unscaled time. WaitForSeconds can only be used with
                    a yield statement in coroutines.</p>
                <p>There are some factors which can mean the actual amount of time waited does not precisely match the
                    amount of time specified:
                    1. Start waiting at the end of the current frame. If you start WaitForSeconds with duration 't' in a
                    long frame (for example, one which has a long operation which blocks the main thread such as some
                    synchronous loading), the coroutine will return 't' seconds after the end of the frame, not 't'
                    seconds after it was called.
                    2. Allow the coroutine to resume on the first frame after 't' seconds has passed, not exactly after
                    't' seconds has passed.</p>
                <code>public class WaitForSecondsExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(Example());
    }

    IEnumerator Example()
    {
        print(Time.time);
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(5);
        print(Time.time);
